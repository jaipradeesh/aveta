- `gather_data.py` will take the raw data directory and generate data in
label sub-directories. The labels are:

    0 => nop
    1 => forward
    2 => left
    3 => down
    4 => right
    5 => straighten
    6 => halt

- `preprocessing.py` contains simple image processing to isolate the rope. When `--augment` is given, it also flips left <=> right while generating the data.

- `train.py` can then be invoked on the directories generated by either of the above.
