This directory contains a curses based driving command program. Run command.py
and use arrow keys for moving the machine.

control.py contains the Driver class that starts another process for controlling
the motion of the robot by actually sending it commands. command.py talks to this
process via the Driver class' methods. Multiprocessing is necessary if we are
to get user input, record video and send control to the robot all independent
of each other.
